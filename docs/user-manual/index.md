# User Guide

Welcome to the QA Assistant User Guide. This guide helps you go from first install to confident, day-to-day use.

## How display modes work

Display modes control **which menus appear**, not a toggle inside each report.

- **Simple (default)** shows: **Assistants / Realtime / Audience / Settings / Help**
- **Advanced** adds: **Acquisition / Landing Pages / Top Growing / All Pages / Goals**

To enable Advanced Mode: **Settings → Advanced Mode**.
