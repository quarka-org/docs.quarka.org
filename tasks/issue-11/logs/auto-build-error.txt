Warning:  Some blog authors used in "2025-05-25-welcome.md" are not defined in "authors.yml":
- {"name":"QA Advisor Team","title":"Documentation Team","url":"https://github.com/quarka-org","image_url":"https://github.com/quarka-org.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/quarka-org.png","socials":{},"key":null,"page":null}

Note that we recommend to declare authors once in a "authors.yml" file and reference them by key in blog posts front matter to avoid author info duplication.
But if you want to allow inline blog authors, you can disable this message by setting onInlineAuthors: 'ignore' in your blog plugin options.

Warning:  Docusaurus found blog posts without truncation markers:
- "blog/2025-05-25-welcome.md"

We recommend using truncation markers (`<!-- truncate -->` or `{/* truncate */}`) in blog posts to create shorter previews on blog paginated lists.
Tip: turn this security off with the `onUntruncatedBlogPosts: 'ignore'` blog plugin option.
