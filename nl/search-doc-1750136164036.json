This is the most reliable way to preserve the correct script order. Include QA Advisor’s tracking script as part of your defer queue, but after jQuery. For example, if you are managing defer behavior in functions.php, be sure to include QA Advisor's scripts (qa-heatmap-analytics/js) after jQuery in the defer list.  💡 Based on internal testing, deferring jQuery can prevent the QA Advisor tracking script from initializing correctly.
